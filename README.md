# Week 0: Functions, Variables

Welcome to your first programming assignment! This week you'll complete 5 small Python problems to practice the fundamentals.

## Assignment Overview

Complete **ALL** of the following problems from CS50P Week 0:

1. **Indoor Voice** - Convert text to lowercase
2. **Playback Speed** - Replace spaces with ellipses
3. **Making Faces** - Convert emoticons to emoji
4. **Einstein** - Calculate E=mc²
5. **Tip Calculator** - Calculate tip and total

## Before You Begin

Execute `cd` by itself in your terminal window. You should find that your terminal window's prompt resembles the below:
```
$
```

## Starting Each Problem

For each problem, you'll follow this same pattern. Here's an example for the first problem:

### Step 1: Create a folder
```bash
mkdir indoor
```

### Step 2: Navigate into the folder
```bash
cd indoor
```

You should now see your terminal prompt as `indoor/ $`

### Step 3: Create your Python file
```bash
code indoor.py
```

This will open a new file where you'll write your program.

### Repeat for Each Problem

Follow the same pattern for all five problems:
- `indoor` → `indoor.py`
- `playback` → `playback.py`
- `faces` → `faces.py`
- `einstein` → `einstein.py`
- `tip` → `tip.py`

## Submission

When you've completed all five problems:
1. Test each program thoroughly
2. Commit your changes: `git add .` then `git commit -m "Complete Week 0"`
3. Push to GitHub: `git push`

Your submission will be automatically recorded when you push to your repository.

## Getting Help

- Review the problem specifications carefully
- Test your code with the examples provided
- Use `print()` statements to debug
- Ask for help if you're stuck!

## Academic Honesty

Remember to follow the course's academic honesty policy. Write your own code and understand every line you submit.
## Testing Your Code

Before submitting, test each problem with `check50`:

```bash
check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/indoor

check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/faces
check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/einstein
check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/tip
```

## Submitting

Submit each problem with `submit50`:

```bash
submit50 cs50/problems/2022/python/indoor
